## Technical Requirements

* **Build a full-stack application** by making my own backend and my own frontend.
* **Use a Python Flask API** using a Flask REST Framework to serve my data from a Postgres database.
* **Consume my API with a separate front-end** built with React.
* **Be a complete product** which includes multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for models.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
